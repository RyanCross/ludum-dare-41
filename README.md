### Set up
Before you do anything in the project, please do the following: 
Go to Edit -> Project Settings
Under Version Control make sure Mode is set to "Visible Meta Files"

### Fun facts:
You can't commit empty folders to unity projects, git doesn't like empty folders but unity will create meta files for those empty folders. 
Which is === a bad time. So make sure you have a file (or an empty text file) if you want to create a new folder to store stuff in.
